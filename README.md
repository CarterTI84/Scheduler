Welcome to the Scheduler app! 

This application provides students and parents with a secure and easy to use scheduling app for all their tasks.

It's as simple as creating an account in the application that will give you admin access inside the application.

After launching the app, if an account does not exist, click “Create Account”.
Enter in your credentials. (Make sure that the password is separate than your real email password to uphold security!)

If an account exists, enter in your credentials and click “Log in”.

Then, you will come across a screen where you can either choose to create a new “Assignment” or “View” the current ones.

If you want to create a new assignment, click “Create New Assignment”.
Next, enter in the assignment title and the due dates. Please make sure to refrain from entering “0” prior to singular values (ie: “09”).
Next, click done. You can then create another assignment or choose to view all current assignments. 

If you want to view all assignments, click “View All Assignments”. 
Here, you can click on the header of the table to sort your assignments in various orders, remove an assignment, or go to the preview window.

When removing assignments, click the assignment you wish to delete and click “Remove Assignment”. The program will then prompt you to enter in your password to confirm the deletion.


Thank you for trying our app!
